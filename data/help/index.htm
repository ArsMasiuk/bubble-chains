<h1>Aim of the game</h1>

<p>The aim of Bubble Chains is to remove all of the targets on each level, and to do this before the time (indicated with the blue-colored bar at the right) runs out. 
Keep doing this until you have passed the last level and won the game.

<h1>How to play</h1>

<p>You have to collect color bubbles on the field by combining them into chains of three or more bubbles.
To do this, press left mouse button on a bubble and drag the mouse over the surrounding bubbles of the same color.
When all the desired bubbles are connected, release the button, and the chain will disappear. 
<p>
Do not release the button until the whole chain is combined. If you want to cancel current combination, just drag the mouse over the bubbles back.

<p>Except of the color bubbles, there are special items which can be used as a placeholder for any bubble, making your life easier.

<p>And remember: the longer chain is, the more points you get. A 8-bubble chain will give you more score than two 4-bubble ones, for example. 
So always look for the longest possible combination (but don't forget about running time!).

<h1>Targets</h1>

<p>There are several targets of different types assigned randomly for each level (you can see them at the bottom of the screen).
Targets are initially empty, but getting filled when you're collecting chains of the corresponding type. 
A filled target disappears - so when all of them are gone, the level is won!

<table class="hidden">
<tr><td class="list"><img src="img64_base.png"></td><td class="list"><b>Simple targets</b> are the easiest to remove. 
Just collect any chains and fill the targets. Neither color nor lenght of chains are important.</td>

<tr><td class="list"><img src="img64_number.png"></td><td class="list"><b>Numeric targets</b> have a number in the middle. 
This number indicates the minimum lenght of chains you have to collect in order to fill such a target.
Color of chains is not important as well.</td>

<tr><td class="list"><img src="img64_color.png"></td><td class="list"><b>Color targets</b> are filled when you're collecting chains of the corresponding color. 
Lenght of a chain is not important.</td>

<tr><td class="list"><img src="img64_faller.png"></td><td class="list"><b>Fall targets</b> are not supposed to be filled. 
Instead, falling items appear on the field, and you have to let them reach the most bottom line of the field.
Once falling item is there, it disappears with the target.

<p>Falling items can not be combined into chains - so just give them a way to fall!</td>

</table>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>There is a green-colored bar at the left side which represents the amount of the score needed for activating a tool. 
Tools can help you pass the level significantly faster.

<p>A tool is activated when the bar is full. Just collect color chains, and the bar will be rising until it reaches its top.
Then you'll get the tool which is shown above the bar.

<p>Longer chains giving you more points. Below the bar, there is an indicator of the longest chain you were able to collect during the game.
Increasing this value lets you constantly spending less points needed to get next tools.

<p>The following tools are available:

<tr><td class="list"><img src="kill.png"></td><td class="list"><b>Item Killer</b><br>destroys a single item in the field</td>
